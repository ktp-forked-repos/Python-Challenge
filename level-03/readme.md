## Level 3

url: [http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/equality.html](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/equality.html)

**Solution**:

First of all, the hidden message is also in the page's source. I store that message in a text file as usual.

The picture is a small candle in front of two sets of three-big-candle. The hint in this challenge is "One small letter, surrounded by EXACTLY three big bodyguards on each of its sides." So, our mission is to find all small letters which is in the middle of EXACTLY three capital letters.

In [solution 1](), I programmed an small agorithm to solve the problem. The anser is "linkedlist".

In [solution 2](), I used regular expression to find the pattern the problem want and I can get the same key word. Besides, we can see that using regular expression can make the code extremely concide and pretty. I think I'm starting falling in love with regular expression:) 

When I replace "equality" to "linkedlist", the page tell us "linkedlist.php". So I changed the url from "linkedlist.html" to "linkedlist.php", and boom, new challenge time! :)

**Code Word for Next Challenge**: linkedlist
