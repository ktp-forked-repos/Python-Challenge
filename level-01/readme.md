**Solution**:

The picture is just a sample for how to translate the code on three chacters. The first character in the code 'g' let me think that must be 'I', which is two positions behind 'g'. So, I try to let every character two positions behind and then get the real content of the code as follows:

> i hope you didnt translate it by hand. thats what computers are for. doing it in by hand is inefficient and that's why this text is so long. using string.maketrans() is recommended. now apply on the url.

This method also let the hint "everybody thinks twice before solving this." make sense:)

Through the real message, I also learnt how to use with the ``str.maketrans`` and ``str.translate`` functions. That's cool!

Then, I use this simple translation rule upon the the url word - 'map', and get the code word for the next challenge: ocr :)    

**Code Word for Next Challenge**: ocr
